                            PREAMBLE

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from restricting
those rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities
to respect the freedom of others.
